# Flask API with Postgres

> [!TIP]
> To deploy this project using **GUI-based flow**, navigate to [console](https://console.stacktape.com/create-new-project/git-project-using-console?name=my-stacktape-app&repositoryType=public&repositoryUrl=https://github.com/stacktape/starter-flask-api-postgres)

- simple HTTP API built using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/).
- The application runs in a [web service](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/web-services/) resource and uses
  a Postgres [relational database](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/relational-databases/) to store the data.
- This project includes a pre-configured [stacktape.yml configuration](stacktape.yml).
The configured infrastructure is described in the [stack description section](#stack-description)

## Pricing

- Fixed price resources:

  - **Relational (SQL) database** ($0.017/hour, ~$12.5/month, [free-tier eligible](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all))
  - **Web service** (~$0.012/hour, ~$9/month)

- There are also other resources that might incur costs (with pay-per-use pricing). If your load won't get high, these costs will be close to $0.

## 1. Generate your project
To initialize the project, use

```bash
stacktape init --starterId flask-api-postgres
```

## 2. Before deploy
 - Install your projects dependencies. The recommended way is to use [Virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

## 3. Deploy your stack

The deployment will take ~5-15 minutes. Subsequent deploys will be significantly faster.

<details>
<summary>Deploy from local machine</summary>

<br />

The deployment from local machine will build and deploy the application from your system. This means you also need to have:
- Docker. To install Docker on your system, you can follow [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).- [Python version > 3.9](https://www.python.org/) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) package manager installed.

<br />

To perform the deployment, use the following command:

```bash
stacktape deploy --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

`stage` is an arbitrary name of your environment (for example **staging**, **production** or **dev-john**)

`region` is the AWS region, where your stack will be deployed to. All the available regions are listed below.

<br />

| Region name & Location     | code           |
  | -------------------------- | -------------- |
  | Europe (Ireland)           | eu-west-1      |

## 4. Test your application

After a successful deployment, some information about the stack will be printed to the terminal (**URLs** of the deployed services, links to **logs**, **metrics**, etc.).

To test the application, you will need the web service URL. It's printed to the terminal.

### Create a post
Make a `POST` request to `<<web_service_url>>/post` with the JSON data in its body to save the post. Use your preferred HTTP client or
the following cURL command:

```bash
curl -X POST <<web_service_url>>/posts -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{ "title": "MyPost", "content": "Hello!", "authorEmail": "info@stacktape.com"}'
```

If the above cURL command did not work, try escaping the JSON content:

```bash
curl -X POST <<web_service_url>>/posts -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{ \"title\":\"MyPost\",\"content\":\"Hello!\",\"authorEmail\":\"info@stacktape.com\"}'
```

### Get all posts

Make a `GET` request to `<<web_service_url>>/posts` to get all posts.

```bash
curl <<web_service_url>>/posts
```




## 5. Hotswap deploys
- Stacktape deployments use [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) under the hood. It
  brings a lot of guarantees and convenience, but can be slow for certain use-cases.

- To speed up the deployment, you can use the `--hotSwap` flag that avoids Cloudformation.
- Hotswap deployments work only for source code changes (for lambda function, containers and batch jobs) and for content uploads to buckets.
- If the update deployment is not hot-swappable, Stacktape will automatically fall back to using a Cloudformation deployment.
```bash
stacktape deploy --hotSwap --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

## 6. Delete your stack

- If you no longer want to use your stack, you can delete it.
- Stacktape will automatically delete every infrastructure resource and deployment artifact associated with your stack.

```bash
stacktape delete --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

# Stack description

  Stacktape uses a simple `stacktape.yml` configuration file to describe infrastructure resources, packaging, deployment
  pipeline and other aspects of your project.

  You can deploy your project to multiple environments (stages) - for
  example `production`, `staging` or `dev-john`. A stack is a running instance of an project. It consists of your application
  code (if any) and the infrastructure resources required to run it.

  The configuration for this project is described below.

  ## 1. Resources

  - Every resource must have an arbitrary, alphanumeric name (A-z0-9).
  - Stacktape resources consist of multiple underlying AWS or 3rd party resources.
### 1.1 Web Service

Application runs in web-service resource and is configured as follows:

- **Packaging** - determines how the Docker container image is built. In this case, we are using
  `stacktape-image-buildpack`. We only need to configure `entryfilePath`. Stacktape automatically builds the application
  code with all of its dependencies, builds the Docker image, and pushes it to a pre-created image repository on AWS.
  You can also use
  [other types of packaging](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/packaging/#packaging-web-services).
- **ConnectTo list** - we are adding database `mainDatabase` into `connectTo` list. By doing this, Stacktape will
  automatically inject relevant environment variables into the container runtime (such as the connection string required
  to connect to the database)
- [Resources](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/web-services#resources). The cheapest available resource
  configuration is `0.25` of virtual CPU and `512` MB of RAM.
- For convenience, automatic CORS is enabled.

You can also configure [scaling](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/web-services#scaling). New (parallel)
container can be added when (for example) the utilization of your CPU or RAM gets larger than 80%. The traffic is evenly
distributed to all the containers.

```yml
resources:
  webService:
    type: web-service
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-image-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: .\app.py
      resources:
        cpu: 0.25
        memory: 512
      connectTo:
        - mainDatabase
      cors:
        enabled: true
```

### 1.2 Postgres relational database

The application data is stored in a Postgres database. The database is configured as follows:

- **Database credentials**. In this example, we input them directly. In production, you should use
  [secrets](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/secrets/) to store them securely.

- **Engine type**. We are using `postgres` engine. It uses a single-node database server - the simplest and cheapest
  option.

- **Instance size**. We are using the `db.t3.micro` instance. It has 1 vCPU, 1GB of memory, and is free-tier eligible
  (~$12.5/month without a free tier). To see the full list of available options, refer to
  [AWS instance type list](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/instance-types/).

By default, the version used for the database is the latest AWS-supported stable version (currently `13.4`). Minor
version upgrades are done automatically.

You can also configure many other aspects of your database, such as
[storage](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/relational-databases/#storage),
[logging](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/relational-databases/#logging),
[read replicas](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/relational-databases/#read-replicas), or
[failover instances](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/relational-databases/#multi-az-mode).

```yml
mainDatabase:
  type: relational-database
  properties:
    credentials:
      masterUserPassword: my_secret_password
    engine:
      type: postgres
      properties:
        primaryInstance:
          instanceSize: db.t3.micro
```

## 2. Database migration hooks

To simplify database access and migrations, this project uses
[Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) together with
[flask migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.

To automatically perform migration after every deployment, the stacktape configuration contains a
[script](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/scripts/) and a
[hook](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/hooks/).

[Script](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/scripts/) specifies the command to be executed. To execute it
automatically every time before the stack is deployed, we reference it inside a
[hook](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/hooks/).

We also need to pass the `STP_MAIN_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable to the script. We do it using the
[$ResourceParam()](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/directives/#resource-param) directive that will
automatically download the connection string value and pass it to the script.

```yml
scripts:
  migrateDb:
    executeCommand: poetry run flask db stamp head && poetry run flask db migrate && poetry run flask db upgrade
    environment:
      - name: STP_MAIN_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING
        value: $ResourceParam('mainDatabase', 'connectionString')

hooks:
  - triggers: ["after:deploy"]
    scriptName: migrateDb
```

You can also execute the migration script anytime using

```bash
stp script:run --scriptName migrateDb --stage <<previously-used-stage>> --region <<previously-used-region>>
```
